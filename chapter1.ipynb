This is required after print, and everything in between the `()` is printed. Inside the `()` we have `'Hello World'`, which is what got printed.  `'Hello World'` is a string, which is a fancy way to say that it's printable letters and numbers. Strings are one type of data that Python works with. You will learn about other data types soon too.\n",

    "When Python encounters a `'` or `\"` it reads everything after that, until the next `'` or `\"` as a string. The quotation marks are not part of the string.

Try printing something with an `'` in it, below. `print(<something with a ' in it>)`. This is practice using the `print` command and practice attention to detail.\n",
