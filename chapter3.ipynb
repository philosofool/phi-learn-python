List may contain any kind of data and you can mix that data in anyway you like: `['spiderman', 'cap', 'hulk']` is a list. `[3.1415, 'pi']` is a list. You can even make a list whose members are lists: `[[Luke, Han, Leia], ['Spiderman', 'Cap', 'Hulk']]` is a list of lists.\n",

    "_Functions_ are an important group of things in Python. Unlike strings, numbers and lists, functions aren't a kind of data. Rather, functions tell a computer to do something. You have already learned about two functions, `print` and `input`. `sorted` is another example of a function. Since `sorted` takes some data and gives new data based on the data it was given, it's a little more like a typical function. Most functions do something like that: they give new data based on the data they are given. \n",

    "Functions in Python often take _arguments_. Arguments are the data that the function works on. In `sorted([2, 1])`, the `()` hold the argument, which is a list `[2, 1]`. Some functions take more than one argument, like `sum`, which can take two numbers and add them, like `sum(2, 2)`."

Notice that although we `sorted` `avengers` a above, it is in it's original order. This is handy if we want to know what the smallest member of a list is without changing it. For example, we might make a list of Avengers in order of when they joined the team. If we want to know the order, alphabetically, we probably don't want to destroy information about the order they joined in when we do that. `sorted` doesn't change our list so it won't destroy that information!"
